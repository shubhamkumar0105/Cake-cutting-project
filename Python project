'''
Given an integer N and cake which can be cut into pieces, each cut should be straight line going from the
center of the cake to its border. Also, the angle between any two cuts must be a positive integer. Two pieces are equal
if their appropriate angles are equal.

The given cake can be cut in following three ways:

# Cut the cake into N equal pieces.
# Cut the cake into N pieces of any size.
# Cut the cake into N pieces such that no two of them are equal.

cakeangle=int(input("Enter the angle of the cake: "))
N=int(input("Enter N: "))
#CASE-1:
if (cakeangle%N==0):
    print("Yes,it is possible to cut the cake into",N,"equal pieces")
else:
    print("No,it is not possible to cut the cake into",N,"equal pieces")

#Case-2:
if (cakeangle>=N):
    print("Yes,it is possible to cut the cake into",N,"pieces of any size")
else:
    print("No,it is not possible to cut the cake into",N,"pieces of any size")

#Case-3:
